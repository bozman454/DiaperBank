## Usage

Parents may scan their driver's license by using another app called Scannr. Scannr will pull necessary information from the driver's license and store it on a local Mongo database. Parents may then enter their children's information and confirm that all the information entered is correct. Once the information is submitted it is passed to a CSV file and deleted from the database.
