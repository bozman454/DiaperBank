            2015, we’ve served a total of 761 babies (who met age and documentation requirements) a total of 2,395 times. The total number of diapers
            distributed over the lifetime of the program is 82,486. We serve an average of 83 babies per distribution, and our records indicate that we
            currently have 360 babies who are eligible to receive aid. Our next distribution date is on Friday, September 27, 2019, and will be held once per
            month during the school’s 2019-2020 academic calendar.
            The Diaper Bank is a partnership between (1) Community Church, Short Hills, (2) the Irvington school district, and (3) the Community Food
            Bank of New Jersey. We are tax-exempt as a registered non-profit organization through permit number EO-221-551-927/000.
            The Diaper Bank is staffed by volunteers from Community Church, high school students from the Imani Program in Irvington (an outreach
            program for at-risk teens), and staff from the Irvington school district. It is operated by the staff of Community Church and the Superintendent
            of the Irvington school district.</p>
